# EZ Trading - English Localization Review

## 🎯 Current Issues with Translation

### Major Problems Identified:
1. **Chinglish expressions** - Direct translation without considering English usage patterns
2. **Awkward phrasing** - "Trade Like You Swipe TikTok" sounds unnatural
3. **Incorrect terminology** - "K lines" should be "candlesticks" or "candles" 
4. **Missing localization** - Not adapted for US market context

## 📋 **Proposed Final English Version**

### Hero Section
```
"Smart Crypto Trading for Everyone"
"AI-powered platform that makes crypto trading accessible, profitable, and stress-free"

[Try Live Demo] [View Performance]
```

### Navigation
```
Platform | Live Performance | Tokenomics | Roadmap | Get Started
```

### Key Features Rename
- AI Oracle → **AI Trading Signals**
- Daily Check-in → **Daily Rewards** 
- One-Click Following → **Smart Copy Trading**
- Viral Invitation → **Referral Program**
- Staking Mining → **Staking Rewards**

### Trading Interface
- All current trading terms are mostly correct ✅

---

## 🎯 **Tone & Voice Guidelines**

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** US retail crypto traders (18-45)
- **Secondary:** International English-speaking crypto enthusiasts
- **Tertiary:** Traditional traders exploring crypto

### Voice Characteristics
- **Professional but approachable** - Not too technical, not too casual
- **Confident without being arrogant** - Trust-building language
- **Clear and direct** - No unnecessary complexity
- **Action-oriented** - Focus on benefits and outcomes

### Language Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ "Very good/nice/great" (non-specific)
- ❌ "Simply/Just/Easy" (overused, diminishes complexity)
- ❌ Direct translations from Chinese idioms
- ❌ Overly enthusiastic punctuation (!!!)

### Language Patterns to Use
- ✅ Specific benefits ("15% higher returns")
- ✅ Social proof ("Join 10,000+ traders")
- ✅ Action verbs ("Optimize", "Maximize", "Streamline")
- ✅ Industry-standard terminology

---

## ✅ **Next Steps**

1. **Review this document** - Please approve the direction
2. **Implement high-priority fixes** - Start with hero and navigation  
3. **Test with native speakers** - Get feedback on naturalness
4. **A/B test key messaging** - Especially hero section
5. **Finalize and deploy** - Complete localization

---

**Question for Review:** 
Should we maintain some crypto/DeFi specific terminology that the target audience expects, or go more mainstream/accessible?
